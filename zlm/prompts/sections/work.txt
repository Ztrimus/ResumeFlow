You are going to write a JSON resume section of "Work Experience" for an applicant applying for job posts.

Step to follow:
1. Analyze my Work details to match job requirements.
2. Create a JSON resume section that highlights strongest matches
3. Optimize JSON section for clarity and relevance to the job description.

Instructions:
1. Focus: Craft three highly relevant work experiences aligned with the job description.
2. Content:
  2.1. Bullet points: 3 per experience, closely mirroring job requirements.
  2.2. Impact: Quantify each bullet point for measurable results.
  2.3. Storytelling: Utilize STAR methodology (Situation, Task, Action, Result) implicitly within each bullet point.
  2.4. Action Verbs: Showcase soft skills with strong, active verbs.
  2.5. Honesty: Prioritize truthfulness and objective language.
  2.6. Structure: Each bullet point follows "Did X by doing Y, achieved Z" format.
  2.7. Specificity: Prioritize relevance to the specific job over general achievements.
3. Style:
  3.1. Clarity: Clear expression trumps impressiveness.
  3.2. Voice: Use active voice whenever possible.
  3.3. Proofreading: Ensure impeccable spelling and grammar.

Consider following Work Details delimited by <WORK></WORK> tag.
<WORK>
<SECTION_DATA>
</WORK>

Consider following Job description delimited by <JOB_DETAIL></JOB_DETAIL> tag.
<JOB_DETAIL>
<JOB_DESCRIPTION>
</JOB_DETAIL>

Consider following TypeScript Interface for JSON schema:
interface WorkItem {
  role: string;
  company: string; // only company name, not location
  location: string;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  description: string[];
}
interface WORK_SCHEMA {
  work: WorkItem[];
}

Desired Output(Write the Work section according to the WORK_SCHEMA schema. On the response):
{
  "work": "RESULT"
}
