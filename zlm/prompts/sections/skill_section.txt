You are going to write a JSON resume section of "Skills" for an applicant applying for job posts.

Step to follow:
1. Analyze my Skills details to match job requirements.
2. Create a JSON resume section that highlights strongest matches.
3. Optimize JSON section for clarity and relevance to the job description.

Instructions:
- Specificity: Prioritize relevance to the specific job over general achievements.
- Proofreading: Ensure impeccable spelling and grammar.

Consider following Skills Details delimited by <SKILL_SECTION></SKILL_SECTION> tag.
<SKILL_SECTION>
<SECTION_DATA>
</SKILL_SECTION>

Consider following Job description delimited by <JOB_DETAIL></JOB_DETAIL> tag.
<JOB_DETAIL>
<JOB_DESCRIPTION>
</JOB_DETAIL>

Consider following TypeScript Interface for JSON schema:
interface SectionItem {
  name: string;
  skills: string[]
}
interface SKILL_SECTION_SCHEMA {
  skill_section: SectionItem[];
}

Desired Output(Write the Skills section according to the SKILL_SECTION_SCHEMA schema.):
{
  "skill_section": "RESULT"
}
